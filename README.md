## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.



## Conclusions

### 1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

There is higher success rate in countries where Kickstarts are more known and accepted. Success rate is also higher in smaller goal budgets and in the spring and summer months along with the month of December. The subcategory of "plays" is overall more popular. 

### 2. What are some limitations of this dataset?

Data is limited by amount of Kickstarters per country as some countries are better represented. In addition, years represented do not have an equal amount of representation in data with unreported reasons within this project. Success and failure rate is not correlated to any country or societal reasons that would skew months or year of data available. 

### 3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Scatter graph to determine any potential outliner in each country. Bar graph showing success, failure, and canceled by country.
